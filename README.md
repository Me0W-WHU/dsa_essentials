## Description

Do not reinvent the wheels.

That said, there are some data structures & algorithms (DSAs) that just can’t be thoroughly understood without experimentation.

This repository contains implementation of data structures and algorithms that every CS student should be familiar with. By familiar I mean knowing every detail of it, including theoretical & implemental details.

You will see my own implementation of these DSAs in C++, with notes on critical points such as the obstacles I’ve met, and my thoughts on efficiency, robustness, and reusability of code.

I do not imply to follow the track of a standard textbook. We will skip the easy part and start with some REAL important DSAs, which might come handy to us in programming contests or in job interviews.

## Description in Chinese

我保留了一些数据结构和算法，只有这样才知道你学的是计算机。

## Reference

1. THU DSA MOOC course materials by Junhui Deng.
   - Mr. Deng’s implementation has numerous characteristics that are worth studying. Firstly, it leverages many advanced features of C++, such as class, template, and operator overloading. Secondly, it places significant emphasis on encapsulation and interface reusability, making the implementation style more akin to that of a standard library. However, although already sacrificed some of its robustness for simplicity, it still possesses a complicated structure and an overwhelming amount of code. As a result, it is more valuable for educational purposes than practical applications.
2. Programming Contest Challenge Book, the second edition by Takuya Akiba et. al.
   - The book provides valuable insights on practical implementation in programming contests. It also includes numerous illustrative examples from the PKU online judge, which showcase the use of various data structures and algorithms.
